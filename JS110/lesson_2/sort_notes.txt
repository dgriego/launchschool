Sorting
=======

In JS, the sort method recieves a callback function that provides with each element of the array.  One
important thing to remember about sorting in JS is that calling sort on an array object without a callback
function will convert the values to string and sort based on each characters "Unicode point value".

it leaves out all undefined values which will be put at the end of an array.

-----------------

IF a *callback* function is used, the sorting will be based on the callback functions return value

The *callback* functions expects a -1, 1, or 0 to be returned in order for the sort to work properly.
This behaves as follows:

- return value > 0 -- A will come after B
- return value < 0 -- A will come before B
- reutnr value === 0 -- keep original order

We are giving instructions on how to treat a and b as the sort algorithm works to put the values in the
proper place.

If we want to sort Ascending, then a being < b becomes important,  in this case we want to return -1.
Because we want A to be sorted BEFORE B.

If A is > B then we return 1 so it is sorted after.

and the reverse for descending.
